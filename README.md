## Specs
* As a user, I want to see several discussion categories (sub-reddits, boards, etc.) on the main page.
  - new
  - your threads/comments/posts
  - show
  - ask
  - jobs
  - submit
* As a user, I want to click a category to visit its collection of posts.
* As a user, I want to click a post to view its contents (For now simply hide/show contents. Routing to a page for a specific post requires concepts from tonight's homework).
* As a user, I want to click on a post to expand/collapse it, so I can view whatever funny picture, link, or news article other users have posted.
* As a user, I want to add new posts to a discussion category.
* As a user, I want to update my post as necessary.
* As a user, I want the option to delete my post.
